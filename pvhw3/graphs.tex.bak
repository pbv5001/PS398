\subsection*{Simulation of predicted values and generation of expected values plot}
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{experiment.png}
\paragraph{}Drawing on regression coefficients presented in table 1 (above), a simulated experiment was constructed in order to investigate how differences in levels of development among repressive and divided societies are associated with predicted levels of political violence. Hypothetical constructs were created for "highly developed repressive and divided regimes" and "low developed repressive and divided regimes" by holding levels of repression and separatism at their third quartile values, while setting energy use to its first quartile value for "low developed" countries and to its third quartile value for "highly developed" countries. The other independent variables (including sanctions and lagged deaths) were held constant at their mean values. Using the regression coefficients produced by equation 1 in table 1, 10,000 simulated draws were taken from a multivariate normal distribution of predicted deaths levels, given each country construct's constellation of coefficients and set levels of the independent variables. Density curves for predicted deaths in each type of country in the experiment are depicted in figure 3 (above). It appears from these simulations that high-energy use countries (which are used to proxy high development) are predicted to experience higher levels of political violence than low-energy use countries, given that repression and separatism are also high. Using the predicted values generated by this simulation, expected values were then calculated by integrating the stochastic component of the model. The stochastic component was modeled by drawing 10,000 values of the error term $\epsilon \sim N(0,\sigma^{2})$. That is, the stochastic component is drawn from the multivariate normal distribution whose mean centers at 0 (thus assuming a Gaussian distribution) and whose standard deviation is described by the residual standard error, calculated from the variance-covariance matrix of the model's predicted values. These values were added to the systematic component of the model, and their density curves plotted in figure 4 (below). Integrating the stochastic component of the model reveals that the model appears to provide more accurate predictive power for deaths among low energy use repressive and divided countries, as indicated by area under the curve primarily ranging from 0-10 deaths with a mean expected value of about 2. The expected values of deaths among high energy use repressive and divided countries were far more distributed, with area under the curve ranging primarily from 0-20 deaths, with a mean expected value of about 3. Thus while it appears that high-energy use countries are expected to experience more deaths when controlling for high levels of repression and separatism, the accuracy of prediction using this covariate is poor. Moreover, expected differences between each type of country are clearly not statistically significant at any reasonable threshold, as the overlayed density curves in figure 4 indicate. I should be briefly noted that the distributions of these density curves are skewed right because the results are presented in deaths per million for a more intuitive understanding, rather than logged deaths per million; thus the untransformed data are skewed because no country experienced "negative deaths," and the deaths variable itself was noted by the authors to be heavily skewed right.

\paragraph{}To evaluate goodness of fit of the bivariate model estimating the relationship between income inequality and political violence deaths, a four-fold cross validation was performed on the Muller \& Sigilson (1987) dataset. Four random samples of 15 observations were taken from the data (without replacement) to use for out of sample testing. Linear models were then estimated for each of the remaining constellation of 45 observations; these models are plotted in figure 3 (above). Four samples of 100 predicted regression equations were then drawn from a normal distribution of coefficients, using each model's regression coefficients and variance covariance matrices (respectively) as the distribution mean and standard deviation. These 100 lines were then plotted against the out-of-sample data in order to visually display the goodness of fit of each model; these 100 regression lines permit the construction of confidence bands around each estimated linear model. Out of sample root mean squared error was also calculated for each of the four cross-validation models in order to provide additional measurements of uncertainty among the models. When comparing each of the cross validation models, differences in RSME were never found to be greater than about 0.30; this provides some indication that findings in the general bivariate model are likely not driven by one or a few specific observations, as the resulting regression coefficients seem to be consistent across sub-samples of the data. Finally, simulations of expected values for deaths in hypothetical countries with mean levels of inequality were conducted; resultant density curves for expected values of deaths across each model are plotted in figure 4 (above). Mean expected deaths were generally the same across all models, and the distribution of expected deaths were also similar. Again, the reader should note that the deaths variable is expressed as deaths per million (as opposed to logged deaths per million) for a more intuitive understanding. Thus according to these results, a prototypical country with mean levels of inequality should expect a mean of roughly 2 deaths per year from political violence, with roughly 95\% of such states expected to experience between 0 and 15 deaths per million. These distributions are skewed right due to the skewed nature of the political deaths variable; most countries experienced political deaths at or near 0, with a few experiencing high deaths.
